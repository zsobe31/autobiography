  <h1>Autobiography</h1>
  <p>I'm <strong>Zsolt Szabo</strong>. I was born in Pécs on May 30, 1972.</p>
  <p>I have been living in a small town near Pécs, in Szentlőrinc since my birth. I went to elementary school, then to vocational secondary school. In 2001 I graduated from the Faculty of Economics at the Győri Széchenyi István College in distance education. At work, on weekends I went to the Penta-Unio educational center in Pécs.</p>
  <p>In April 2000 I was equipped with a Firefighter at the Szigetvár Fire Department
, where I was serving as a subordinate firefighter
, and after completing the college, I have been in the field of office, and I have performed administrative and specialty tasks
.</p>
  <p>In 2012, I moved to the Pécs Fire Department, where I became a commanding team commander. I do this job to this day, I love it, because my profession is a fire fighting life!</p>
  <p>I was married in 2001, since then I live happily married to my wife Annamaria,she is a teacher and three of my children - Bence 15, Dalma 13, Aaron 9 years old.</p>
  <p>My hobbies include sports, regular football, weightlifting and power-training sports.</p>
  <p>The world of computer science has always been interested. In high school, I began to get acquainted with the world of computer science on C64 machines. Later I have put together desktop machines for my own fun.</p>
  <p>In 2017 I began to work with programming in my free time. At the beginning of 2018 I enrolled in <strong>CodeBerry-school</strong> online course I currently do. I learned many new things.</p>
  <p>My current goal is to practice, develop, because of my free time with my graduations - I work for 1 day, I'm on duty and then 2 free days - it is possible for me to exploit these two days in a programming workplace for further development. My English degree is basic, I'm constantly learning.
</p>
  <p>I'm a beginner, student programmer who has a lot to learn!</p>
